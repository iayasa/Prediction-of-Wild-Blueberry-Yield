# Prediction-of-Wild-Blueberry-Yield
Playground Series - Season 3, Episode 14 I Kaggle Competitions




# Objetive

The objective of the "Prediction of Wild Blueberry Yield" competition on Kaggle is to **develop a predictive model that can accurately estimate the performance of wild blueberries**. The provided dataset contains information about various variables related to blueberries, such as observation date, weather conditions, soil type, among other factors.

<br>

The challenge is to **use these variables to build a machine learning model that can predict the yield of blueberries based on the provided characteristics**. By having a reliable predictive model, farmers and blueberry producers can benefit from better anticipation and planning of their harvests, thus optimizing their production and resources.

<br>

In summary, the goal of the competition is to use the **provided dataset to develop an accurate model for predicting the performance of wild blueberries, which could have a positive impact on the agricultural industry**.

  1. **Import Libraries**: Start by importing the necessary libraries and modules that you will need for your analysis and modeling. This may include popular libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib.
   
<br>

  2. **Data Exploration**: exploring the provided dataset in detail. Analyze the different variables and their descriptions. Check for missing values, outliers, and data distribution. Visualize the relationships between variables to gain insights into the data.
   
   <br>

  3. **Data Preprocessing**: Preprocess the dataset to prepare it for modeling. This may involve handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and any other necessary transformations. Explain the reasoning behind each preprocessing step and its impact on the data.
   
   <br>

  4. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features or transform existing ones that might enhance the predictive power of the model. Consider domain knowledge and insights gained from the EDA phase. Explain the feature engineering techniques employed and their relevance to the problem.
   
   <br>

  5. **Train-Validation Split**: Split the preprocessed data into training and validation sets. This allows you to train your models on a subset of the data and evaluate their performance on unseen data. Specify the train-validation split ratio and the reasons behind your choice.
   
   <br>

  6. **Model Selection and Training**: Choose appropriate models for the prediction task, such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting, or neural networks. Train each model using the training set and evaluate their performance on the validation set. Provide details of the models, their hyperparameters, and the reasoning behind your selection.
   
   <br>

  7. **Model Evaluation**: Calculate evaluation metrics (such as MAE, MSE, or R-squared) on the validation set for each trained model. Compare the performance of different models and provide insights into their strengths and weaknesses. Visualize the results to facilitate understanding and interpretation.
   
   <br>

  8. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Fine-tune the hyperparameters of the selected models to improve their performance. Use techniques like GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to find the optimal combination of hyperparameters. Explain the hyperparameters tuned for each model and their impact on the model's performance.
   
   <br>

  9.  **Final Model Selection and Evaluation**: Select the best-performing model based on the validation set's evaluation metrics. Evaluate the final model's performance on the test set to get an estimate of its generalization ability. Calculate the evaluation metrics on the test set and provide an analysis of the final model's performance.
