# Prediction-of-Wild-Blueberry-Yield
Playground Series - Season 3, Episode 14 I Kaggle Competitions




# Objetive

The objective of the "Prediction of Wild Blueberry Yield" competition on Kaggle is to **develop a predictive model that can accurately estimate the performance of wild blueberries**. The provided dataset contains information about various variables related to blueberries, such as observation date, weather conditions, soil type, among other factors.

<br>

The challenge is to **use these variables to build a machine learning model that can predict the yield of blueberries based on the provided characteristics**. By having a reliable predictive model, farmers and blueberry producers can benefit from better anticipation and planning of their harvests, thus optimizing their production and resources.

<br>

In summary, the goal of the competition is to use the **provided dataset to develop an accurate model for predicting the performance of wild blueberries, which could have a positive impact on the agricultural industry**.
